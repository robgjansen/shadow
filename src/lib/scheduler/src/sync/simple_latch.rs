/// `open()` multiple times without making sure that all waiters have successfully returned from
/// `wait()` each time. This typically requires some other synchronization to make sure that the
/// waiters have waited. If the latch and its waiters aren't kept in sync, the waiters will usually
/// panic, but in some cases may behave incorrectly[^note].
